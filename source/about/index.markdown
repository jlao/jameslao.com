My name is James Lao and this is my blog. There are many like it, but this one is mine.


I am a software engineer at Microsoft. I work on cloud security for Xbox LIVE. My job is awesome and I love working on amazing products people love.

I graduated Carnegie Mellon University in December 2011 with a B.S. in Computer Science. Previously I interned at Apple, Amazon, and Vernier Software & Technology.
